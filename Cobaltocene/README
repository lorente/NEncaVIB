Calculation of the PDOS published in 
Garnier et al. The Kondo effect of a molecular tip as a magnetic sensor
Nano Letters 20, 8193 (2020)
However, I could not retrieve the parameters I used for that
calculation, and I used another ones (the frequencies are
the ones from the DFT calculation, but I lost the e-ph couplings).

One of the messages was that a strong structure that people thought
was a molecular orbital, is actually a Kondo+vibrations feature.
